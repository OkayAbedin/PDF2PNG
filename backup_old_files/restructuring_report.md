# PDF2PNG Converter - Project Restructuring Summary

## Overview
The PDF2PNG Converter application has been successfully reorganized into a clean, structured project with proper separation of concerns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure
Created a logical directory structure:
- `/src/`: All source code files (main application, splash screen, starter)
- `/resources/`: Application resources (icons, banner text)
- `/bin/`: Binary dependencies (Poppler binaries)
- `/docs/`: Documentation files (user guide, EULA, release notes)
- `/build/`: Build scripts and configuration files

### 2. Updated File References
- Modified source files to correctly reference resources in the new structure
- Updated the PyInstaller spec file to work with the new directory structure
- Updated the build script to build from the new file locations
- Modified the installer script to package files from the new locations

### 3. Documentation
- Updated README.md with the new project structure and development instructions
- Deprecated the planning document (README_NEW.md)
- Created a verification script to ensure the structure is correct

### 4. Build System
- Ensured the build system worked with the new directory structure
- Updated paths in the build scripts
- Fixed imports in the application code

## What Was Removed
Unnecessary duplicate files were marked for removal and can be cleaned up using the cleanup.ps1 script.

## Next Steps
1. Run a full build to verify everything works correctly
2. Consider removing the backup files once testing confirms everything works
3. Update any deployment scripts to work with the new structure

## Benefits of the New Structure
- Clearer organization of codebase
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance and future development
- More intuitive structure for new developers
- Follows standard Python project conventions
