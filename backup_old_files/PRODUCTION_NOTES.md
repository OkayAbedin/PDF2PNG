## PDF2PNG Converter - OkayAbedin

This document contains important information for making the PDF2PNG Converter completely production-ready.

### Updates Made

1. **Eliminated Console Window**
   - Created a splash screen to show during application startup
   - Created a starter executable that launches the main app without console
   - Added VBS launcher for compatibility with older systems

2. **Fixed PDF Conversion Dialog Flashing**
   - Added proper progress dialog during conversion
   - Implemented background threading for conversion
   - Ensured the UI remains responsive during PDF processing

3. **Fixed About Dialog Issues**
   - Rewrote the about dialog to properly close when dismissed

   - Created professional splash screen with company branding

### Final Steps for Production

1. **Code Signing**
   - For full production deployment, consider code signing the executable and installer
   - This will prevent Windows SmartScreen warnings on user computers

2. **Installer Testing**
   - Test the installer on different Windows versions (10, 11)
   - Verify both admin and non-admin installation paths work correctly

3. **Update Server**
   - Consider implementing an update checking mechanism for future versions
   - This could check a server endpoint for new version information
