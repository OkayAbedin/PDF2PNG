# PDF2PNG Converter - Installation Fix Solution

## Problem Summary
The PDF2PNG Converter application was not working properly after installation because:
1. The executable files (`PDF2PNG_Converter.exe` and `PDF2PNG_Starter.exe`) were not being copied to the installation directory
2. The PATH environment variable was not being properly set to include the Poppler binaries
3. The starter executable was not properly finding and launching the main executable

## Solution Implemented
We've created a comprehensive fix that addresses all these issues:

### 1. Executable Rebuilding and Installation
- Created `complete_fix.ps1` that rebuilds both executables and installs them to the correct location
- Fixed the starter script to properly find the main executable and set the correct environment variables
- Added better error handling and user feedback

### 2. Environment Setup
- Created `Simple_Launcher.bat` that sets the proper PATH environment variable before launching the application
- Updated all shortcuts to use this launcher instead of directly calling the executables
- Ensured Poppler binaries are correctly copied to the installation directory

### 3. Verification Tools
- Created `verify_install.bat` to check the installation for missing components
- Added diagnostic information to help troubleshoot any remaining issues

## How to Fix Installation Issues
If the PDF2PNG Converter isn't working after installation, follow these steps:

1. Run the `complete_fix.ps1` script to rebuild and reinstall all components
2. Use the desktop or Start Menu shortcuts that have been updated to use the proper launcher
3. If issues persist, run `verify_install.bat` from the installation directory to diagnose problems

## Technical Details

### Installation Location
The application is now installed to:
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\PDF2PNG Converter
```

### Required Components
The following components are required for proper operation:
- PDF2PNG_Converter.exe (Main application)
- PDF2PNG_Starter.exe (Console-free starter)
- poppler-bin directory with pdftoppm.exe and related DLLs
- Simple_Launcher.bat (Environment setup launcher)

### Output Directory
Converted PNG files will be saved to:
```
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\PDF2PNG
```

## Future Improvements
For future versions, consider:
1. Creating a proper installer that handles environment setup automatically
2. Adding a built-in update mechanism
3. Implementing code signing for better security
4. Adding an option to customize the output directory
